# TanksGame
New game that i want to make for programmers

So in this game you have a tank and need to get the heightest score by your tank, but just by python script. 

_Ssry i am really bad at writing docs. I will improve my skills_
## Some words about Structure of the project:

There are 2 modules. They works separately. They are connected by database(I am using sqlite)
About the modules:
* __Game_module__
 
 * __Server module__
  All stuff that you can view on the web site. Like: 
    1. Regestration
      Of course you can wake your own accont(rigth now it is very bad-released)
    2. Sing in
      You need to sing in to download your bot. Alsow you can coose your own style.
    3. Leader Board
      You can get to the top by having heightest average score
    3. Spectate games
      Alsow you can spectate games in different rooms
      We start different games on our server(each with 6 or less random bots) you can see their statistic and graphical interface.
